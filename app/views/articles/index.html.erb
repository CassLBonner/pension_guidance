<h1>Check the value of your pension pot</h1>

<p>
  If you’re unsure how much you’ve got in your whole pension pot, or
  how many pots you’ve paid into, there are different ways to find out.
</p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact your pension provider (the pension plan you paid into)</li>
  <li>look at your pension statement - your provider should have sent
    you this once a year
  </li>
  <li>look at your ‘wake-up pack’ - this is the pack you got from your
    pension provider between 4 and 6 months before your agreed
    retirement age (usually between 60 and 65)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you’re less than 4 months away from your retirement age and
  haven’t got a wake-up pack you should contact your pension provider.
</p>

<p>
  You may have paid into more than one pension pot. You’ll need to
  contact each pension provider to find out the value of each one.

    You’ll probably need to know the total value of your pension pot
    if you want to talk to an expert or get useful help on what to do
    with it.
