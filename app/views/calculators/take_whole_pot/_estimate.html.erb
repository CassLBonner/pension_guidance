<p>
  Based on what you’ve told us, if you take your whole <%= number_to_currency(estimate.pot) %>
  pension pot in one go, you could pay:

  <strong class="calculator__estimate__number t-pot-tax">
    <%= number_to_currency(estimate.pot_tax) %> in tax
  </strong>

  and get a total of:

  <strong class="calculator__estimate__number t-pot-received">
    <%= number_to_currency(estimate.pot_received) %>
  </strong>
</p>

<h2>Things to note</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Your total includes your 25% tax-free lump sum</li>
  <li>Money from your pot is added to your other income to work out your tax amount</li>
  <li>This is an estimate — the exact amount of tax you pay depends on your circumstances</li>
</ol>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
  <p>You may pay emergency tax when you take money from your pot which you can claim back</p>
</div>
