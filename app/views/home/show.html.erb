  <p class="lede">This is a free government service which helps you understand what you can do
    with your pension pot when you retire.</p>

  <h2>Pensions are changing</h2>

  <p>From April 2015 you'll have more freedom over how you take money from your pension pot.</p>

  <p>These changes affect you <strong>if you're 55 or over</strong> and have a pension
    based on how much has been paid into your pot (a <strong>defined contribution</strong>
    pension).</p>

  <p>This service explains what your options are, what's tax-free and what's not.</p>
