    helps you understand what you can do with your pension pot when you retire.</p>

  <h2>Pensions are changing</h2>

  <p>From April 2015 you'll have more freedom over how you take money from your pension pot.</p>

  <p>These changes affect you if you're <strong>55 or over</strong> and have a pension
    based on how much has been paid into your pot (a <strong>defined
    contribution pension</strong>).</p>
