  <p>An appointment is a 45 minute conversation between you and a Pension Wise guidance specialist. You’ll get personal guidance on what you can do with your pension pot.</p>

  <p>Appointments are over the <strong>phone</strong> or <strong>face to face</strong></p>

  <h2 id="before-you-book">Before you book</h2>

  <p>You should be aged <strong>50 or over</strong> and have a <strong>defined contribution</strong> pension.
    This is a pension based on how much you and possibly your employer paid into your pot. It’s not a final salary pension.
  </p>

  <p>In your appointment, the guidance specialist will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>explain your pension options</li>
    <li>explain tax</li>
    <li>discuss which options might be suitable for you</li>
    <li>give you tips on what you can do next</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Afterwards you’ll get a letter with a summary of what you talked about.</p>

    <p>Pension Wise guidance specialists are impartial. They don't recommend any products or companies and won’t tell you how to invest your money.</p>
