        <p>You should be close to or over 55 and have a <a href="pension-types">defined contribution pension</a>.
          This is a pension based on how much you and possibly your employer paid into your pot.
          It’s not a final salary pension.</p>

        <h2 id="what-youll-get-from-the-appointment">What you’ll get from the appointment</h2>

        <p>The appointment is a conversation between you and a Pension Wise guidance specialist. You’ll get personal guidance on what you can do with your pension pot.</p>

        <p>The guidance specialist will:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>explain your pension options</li>
          <li>explain tax</li>
          <li>discuss which options might be suitable for you</li>
          <li>give you tips on what you can do next</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>ask questions about the options</li>
          <li>discuss what the options mean to you</li>
          <li>discuss how tax might affect you</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Afterwards you’ll get a letter with a summary of what you talked about.</p>

        <div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
          <p>Pension Wise guidance specialists are impartial. They don't recommend any products or companies and won’t tell you how to invest your money.</p>

        <h2 id="make-the-most-of-your-appointment">Make the most of your appointment</h2>

        <p>Check the value of your pension pot beforehand. Your latest pension statement from your provider will have the amount.</p>

        <p>You should also think about when you want to stop working and how much other income you might have in retirement, eg from savings.</p>
