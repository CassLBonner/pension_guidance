<h1 id="steps-you-need-to-take">6 steps you need to take</h1>

<p>You need to have a <a href="/pension-types">defined contribution pension</a>
  - a pension based on how much has been paid into your pot - for these pension
  choices to apply to you. Check with your pension provider if you’re not sure
  what type of pension you have.</p>

<p>You can either follow these steps in order or simply read the guides you’re most interested in.</p>

      Check how much is in your pot
    </h2>

    <p>You can ask your pension provider to tell you how much is in your pot. You can also look
      at information your provider has sent to you already, eg a pension statement.</p>

      Shop around and compare providers
    </h2>

    <p>Remember that you don’t have to stay with your current pension provider. People usually benefit from taking time to shop around and compare products. The pack your provider sends you when you reach retirement age is likely to only include information about their own products.</p>
