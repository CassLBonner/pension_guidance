<h1 id="steps-you-need-to-take">6 steps you need to take</h1>

<p>You need to have a <a href="/pension-types">defined contribution pension</a>
  - a pension based on how much has been paid into your pot - for these pension
  choices to apply to you. Check with your pension provider if you’re not sure
  what type of pension you have.</p>

<p>You can either follow these steps in order or simply read the guides you’re most interested in.</p>

        Check how much is in your pension pot
      </a>
    </h2>

    <p>You can ask your pension provider to tell you how much is in your pot. You can also look
      at information your provider has sent to you already, eg a pension statement.</p>

        What you can do with your pension pot
      </a>
    </h2>

    <p>Take time to think about which option suits you best. You don’t need to take the first one offered by your pension provider.</p>

    <p>You can:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>leave your pension pot untouched until you need the money - your pot could still grow</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>get a guaranteed income (annuity) - you can take 25% of your pot tax free before buying an annuity</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>take your money flexibly - you can take lump sums of cash or get an income, 25% will be tax free</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>take your whole pension pot as cash - 25% will be tax free</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also mix these options. Check with your pension provider about which options they can offer you.</p>

        Plan how long your money needs to last
      </a>
    </h2>

    <p>Your costs and financial needs are likely to change during retirement. You need to think about when you’ll start taking money from your pension pot and how much you’ll need at different times.</p>

        Work out how much you’ll have in retirement
      </a>
    </h2>

    <p>How much income you have is likely to change as you get older. Work out how much money
      you’ll get from your pension and from other income you have and how it’ll cover your costs.</p>

        Shop around for the best deal

    </h2>

    <p>Remember that you don’t have to stay with your current pension provider. People usually benefit from taking time to shop around and compare products. The pack your provider sends you when you reach retirement age is likely to only include information about their own products.</p>
