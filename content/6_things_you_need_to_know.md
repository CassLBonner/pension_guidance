#6 things you need to know

You need to have a defined contribution pension - a pension based on how much has been paid into your pot - for these pension choices to apply to you. Check with your pension provider if you’re not sure what type of pension you have.

##1. Check how much is in your pension pot

You can ask your pension provider to tell you how much is in your pot. You can also look at information your provider has sent to you already, eg a pension statement.

##2. Understand what you can do with your pension pot

Think about which option suits you best. You don't need to take the first one offered to you by your pension provider.

You can:

- leave your pension pot untouched until you need the money - your pot could still grow

- get a guaranteed income (annuity) - you can take 25% of your pot tax free before buying an annuity

- get a flexible income (income drawdown) - a 25% tax-free lump sum is available if you take this option

- take your whole pension pot as cash - 25% will be tax free

- take smaller sums as cash - 25% of each sum you take will be tax free

You can also mix these options. Check with your pension provider about which options they can offer you.

##3. Plan how long your money needs to last
Your costs and financial needs are likely to change during retirement. You need to think about when you'll start taking money from your pension pot and how much you'll need at different times.

##4. Work out how much you'll need
How much income you have is likely to change as you get older. Work out how much money you'll get from your pension and from other income you have and how it'll cover your costs.

##5. Remember tax
Your income in retirement is taxed, just like it is when you’re in work.

##6. Take your time to shop around
Remember that you don't have to stay with your current pension provider. People usually benefit from shopping around and comparing products. The pack your provider sends you when you reach retirement age is likely to only include information about their own products.
