#6 things you need to know about your pension


Follow these steps to understand what your options for your pension pot are. They explain the most important things you need to know about your income in retirement.

 
##Before you start

You need to have a [defined contribution pension](/articles/understand-your-pension-type#pension-types) for these steps to work. This is a pension based on how much has been paid into your pension pot.

Check with your provider if you’re not sure what type of pension you have.
 
##Your 6 pension steps
 
###1. Check how much you have in your pension pot

You can ask your pension provider to tell you how much is in your pension pot. You can also look at information your provider has sent to you already, eg a pension statement, or the ‘wake-up pack’ your provider sends 4 to 6 months before your agreed retirement age.

###2. Add up your other income

Work out the other income you’ll have in your retirement. This may include:

 
- the State Pension paid to you by the government - use the [State Pension Calculator](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension) to get an estimate of how much you’ll get and when
- money from work, eg if you carry on working for some years
- benefits, eg pension credit, housing benefit, council tax benefit
- rental income
- your savings or pensioner bonds, and the interest you get on these
- investments, and dividends paid to you on these
- money you get from downsizing your property, eg if you sell and move into a smaller home


###3. Understand what you can do with your pension pot
 
Don’t make a rush decision. You have several options:

- [leave your pension pot untouched](/articles/what-you-can-do-with-your-pension-pot#leave-your-pension-pot-untouched) until you need the money

- [take cash](/articles/what-you-can-do-with-your-pension-pot#take-cash) - you can take your whole pot in one go or take smaller sums - 25% will be tax free

- [take money out when you need it](/articles/what-you-can-do-with-your-pension-pot#take-money-out-when-you-need-it-income-drawdown) (income drawdown) - you can still get a 25% tax-free lump sum if you take this option 

- [get a guaranteed income](/articles/what-you-can-do-with-your-pension-pot#get-a-guaranteed-income-annuity) (annuity) - you can still take out 25% of your pot tax free before buying an annuity with the rest 

- [mix these options](/articles/what-you-can-do-with-your-pension-pot#mix-your-pension-options)

Check which of these options your pension provider can offer you. If they don't offer you the option you want to take, you'll normally be able to transfer your pot to another provider that offers the option you want.

###4. Estimate your retirement costs

 
Consider costs that may arrive during your retirement, eg care and living costs, as well as other things like travel and leisure. Remember that costs can change over time, eg care costs could increase.

###5. Calculate your retirement income


To do this you need to add up income from your pension and elsewhere. Take away your regular costs and any tax you have to pay. Think about how your income and costs will change in retirement.


[Calculate your retirement income](/articles/calculate-your-retirement-income) and understanding [how long your money needs to last](/articles/check-the-value-of-your-pension-pot) can help you do this.
 

###6. Don’t forget tax
 

Your income in retirement is taxed, just like it is when you’re in work. [More information on income tax rates.](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates)


Once you’ve added up all your income you’ll need to take tax away.


[Tax you pay on your pension](/articles/tax-you-pay-on-your-pension) can help you with this.
