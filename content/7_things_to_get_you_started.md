#7 things to get you started

##Before you start

You need to have a defined contribution pension - a pension based on how much has been paid into your pot - for these pension choices to apply to you. Check with your pension provider if you’re not sure what type of pension you have.

##Getting started

###1. Check how much is in your pension pot

You can ask your pension provider to tell you how much is in your pot. You can also look at information your provider has sent to you already, eg a pension statement.

###2. Take time to make the right decision for you

Everyone's circumstances are different. Don't rush any decisions about your pension pot.

Remember that whichever option you take, you should have enough money to last through your retirement. If you have a partner or children, think about how your decision will affect them. If you're on benefits, these may be affected by when and how you take your pension.


###3. Add up your other income

As well as your pension pot, you could get income in other ways. These could include your State Pension paid to you by the government, as well as money from work, benefits, savings or investments.

###4. Understand what you can do with your pension pot


You have several options to choose from. You can:

- leave your pension pot untouched until you need the money

- take your whole pension pot or smaller sums as cash - 25% will be tax free

- take money out when you need it (income drawdown) - you can still get a 25% tax-free lump sum if you take this option

- get a guaranteed income (annuity) - you can still take 25% of your pot tax free before buying an annuity with the rest

You can also mix these options. Check with your pension provider about which options they can offer you.

###5. Estimate your costs


Consider costs that may arrive as you get older. These could include living or care costs. Remember that costs can rise or fall over time, eg as you get older you may need to spend more on care costs.

###6. Don't forget tax


Your income in retirement is taxed, just like it is when you’re in work.

###7. Work out your income


Add up income from your pension and elsewhere. Take away your regular costs and any tax you have to pay. Think about how your income and costs will change as you get older.
