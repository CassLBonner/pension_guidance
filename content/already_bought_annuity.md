# If you’ve already bought an annuity

Annuity rules will change in 2017. You may then be able to sell an existing annuity and use the money to get a lump sum or a [adjustable income](/adjustable-income).

^Under current rules, once you’ve bought an annuity you can’t change the decision.^

An annuity provides a guaranteed income for a fixed number of years or the rest of your life. If you already have one, you may decide the best option is to keep it. Selling an annuity is a big decision and you should think carefully about it. You might want to speak to a [financial adviser](/financial-advice) before you make a decision.

%Pension Wise currently doesn’t provide guidance if you want to sell an existing annuity.%

## The new annuity rules

Under the new rules you won’t be able to sell your existing annuity back to your provider.

The Government is currently deciding on how the new rules could work and will give more details nearer the time. To find out more you can read the full [annuity announcement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pension-freedoms-to-be-extended-to-people-with-annuities).

If you’re thinking of selling your annuity to pay off debts, you should get advice first.

The [Money Advice Service](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en) and [Citizens Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk) services both offer free and impartial debt advice.
