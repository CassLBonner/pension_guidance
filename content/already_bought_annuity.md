# If you’ve already bought an annuity

Annuity rules will change in April 2016. You may be able to sell an existing annuity and use the money to get a lump sum or a [flexible income](/adjustable-income).

^Under current rules, once you’ve bought an annuity you can’t change the decision.^

Annuities provide a guaranteed income for a fixed number of years or the rest of your life. If you’ve already bought an annuity, you may decide the best option is to keep it. Selling an annuity is a big decision and you should think about this carefully. You might want to speak to a [financial adviser](/shop-around#getting-financial-advice) before you make a decision.

%Pension Wise currently doesn’t provide guidance for people looking to sell their existing annuities.%

## The new annuity rules

Under the new rules you won’t be able to sell your existing annuity back to your provider.

The government is currently deciding on how the new rules could work and will give more details nearer the time. To find out more you can read the Chancellor’s full [annuities announcement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pension-freedoms-to-be-extended-to-people-with-annuities).

If you’re thinking of selling your annuity next year to pay off debts, you should get advice first.

The [Money Advice Service](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en) and [Citizens Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk) services both offer free and impartial debt advice.
