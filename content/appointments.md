#Pension Wise guidance appointments

You can book a phone or face-to-face guidance appointment to help you understand your pension options. 

You’ll talk about:

- the different ways you can take money from your pot
- what each option means for your circumstances
- next steps you can take

##Speak over the phone or face to face

Appointments are free and impartial. Phone appointments are with The Pensions Advisory Service and face-to-face appointments take place at branches of the Citizens Advice services.

Afterwards you'll receive a letter with a summary of the pension options and what they mean for your circumstances.

^Pension Wise guidance specialists don’t recommend any products or companies and won’t tell you how to invest your money.^

##Who can book

You can book if:

 - you're close to or over 55, and
 - have a personal or workplace pension based on how much has been paid into your pot - a [defined contribution pension](/pension-types).

##Preparing for your appointment

To make your appointment as useful as possible, it would be helpful to know the following information:

- the value of your pension pot(s) - check your pension paperwork or ask your provider 
- an estimate of your State Pension - call the Future Pension Centre on 0845 600 4274 for a State Pension statement
- any special arrangements attached to your pension pot, eg a guaranteed annuity rate or a guaranteed pot value at a certain time - ask your provider 

Think about your financial circumstances in general and plans for retirement, eg:

- sources of income like salary, benefits, savings, investments 
- debts and repayments you might have 
- when you want to stop working
- if you want a fixed or flexible income in retirement

##How to book

Call 0300 330 1001 between 8am and 10pm, Monday to Sunday. Calls cost the same as a normal call - if your calls are free, it's included.

^Pension Wise only provides guidance on what you can do with a [defined contribution pension](/pension-types) - you can get help with defined benefit pensions at [The Pensions Advisory Service](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk)^
