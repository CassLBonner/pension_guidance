# Book a free Pension Wise appointment

An appointment is a conversation with a Pension Wise guidance specialist. They last around 45 to 60 minutes. Afterwards you’ll get a written summary of what was discussed.

In your appointment, we will:

- talk about the ways you can take your pension money
- explain how each pension option is taxed
- give you next steps to take

You can speak to us over the phone or face to face somewhere local to you.

## Before you book

You should be aged **50 or over** and have a **defined contribution** pension. This is a pension based on how much you and possibly your employer paid into your pot. It’s not a final salary pension.

^ Pension Wise guidance specialists are impartial. They don’t recommend any products or companies and won’t tell you how to invest your money.
