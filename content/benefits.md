description: How taking your pension can affect your benefits. Usually, the greater your income, the fewer benefits you’ll get.

#If you’re on benefits

Usually, the more you have in income and savings, the less you’ll receive in benefits. Your income includes any money from your pension pot, eg taking a tax-free lump sum.

Money from your pension could increase your total income to a level that means you’re not eligible for a certain benefit any more.

Your eligibility for some benefits depends on what other income you have. Any income you get from your pension, eg a guaranteed income (annuity), will count towards the income these benefits are assessed against.

Your eligibility for some benefits is affected by what benefits you already get or by your other circumstances (eg savings, or if you have a disability).

**Example** Your income is £125 per week. You get Guarantee Credit (a part of Pension Credit), which increases your income to £151.20. You then buy an annuity and your income increases to £220 per week. As you now earn more than £151.20 - the Guarantee Credit threshold for the 2015 to 2016 tax year - you don’t qualify for Guarantee Credit any more.

If you deliberately spend or give away money (including tax-free cash) from your pension pot to appear more eligible for benefits or help with care costs, your council may investigate. It may also look again at your eligibility, by assuming you still have that money.
