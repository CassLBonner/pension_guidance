# Check if you can sell your annuity

You may be able to sell your annuity if it's one you set up yourself and the policy is in your name. 

For example, if you arranged to buy an annuity using your pension pot, you may be able to sell it.

This includes single and joint-life annuities.

## When you can’t sell

You won’t be able to sell your annuity if:

- you have a [defined benefit](/pension-types) pension
- your pension is in the name of the company you worked for or the company you bought the annuity from

You may be able to re-assign the annuity to your name and then sell it. Speak to your provider to find out if you can and what the fees are.

## If you don’t know your annuity details

Speak to your bank or savings account provider if you don’t know who your annuity provider is. They should tell you who the payments come from – you can then contact your annuity provider to find out if it’s in your name.
