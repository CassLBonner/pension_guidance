# Check if you can sell your annuity

^Annuity rules will change in 2017. You may then be able to sell an annuity. Under current rules, once you’ve bought an annuity you can’t change the decision.^

You may be able to [sell your annuity](/how-to-sell-annuity) if it’s one you set up yourself and it's in your name. 

For example, if you had a [defined contribution](/pension-types) pension which was arranged by you and used to buy the annuity, you should be able to sell it.

## When you can’t sell

You won’t be able to sell your annuity if it's in the name of the company you worked for or bought it from.

You may be able to re-assign the annuity to your name and then sell it. Speak to your provider to find out if you can and what the fees are.

## If you don’t know your annuity details

Speak to whoever your payments go to, eg your bank or savings account provider if you don’t know who your annuity provider is.

They should be able to tell you who the annuity payments come from. You can then contact your provider to find out if it’s in your name.
