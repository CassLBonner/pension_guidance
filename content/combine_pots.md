# Combine different pension pots

If you’ve had more than one job, it’s likely that you’ve paid into more than one [defined contribution](/pension-types) pension pot. You can combine your pots before you start taking money. This could make your pensions easier to manage and help you save on administration fees.

You may also want to combine pots if you’re [moving abroad](https://www.gov.uk/transferring-your-pension/transferring-to-an-overseas-pension-scheme) and want to move your pension to a scheme in that country.

You may be charged fees to transfer one pot to another. You could lose some of your money or any special features, eg a guaranteed annuity rate.

^You’ll need to speak to each provider separately to find out their rules on combining pots.^  

## Defined benefit pensions

If you have a final salary or career average pension (‘defined benefit’), you would need to transfer it to a defined contribution pension to be able to choose one of the [6 pension options](/pension-pot-options). 

The value of your defined benefit pension gets transferred as cash and is invested into a defined contribution pot. You would then have the same options as people with defined contribution pensions.

Some defined benefit pensions, eg NHS pensions, don’t allow you to transfer out – ask your scheme administrator.

%Think very carefully before you transfer a defined benefit pension into a defined contribution one – it’s likely you’ll be worse off.%

## Getting financial advice

Legally you must get independent [financial advice](/financial-advice) if you want to transfer out of a:

- defined benefit pension worth more than £30,000 (known as your ‘safeguarded benefits’)
- defined contribution pension worth more than £30,000 with a guarantee about what you’ll be paid when you retire (eg a guaranteed annuity rate)
