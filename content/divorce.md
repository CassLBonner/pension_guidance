#If you're divorced

The way that a couple's pension is dealt with, when they divorce or have their civil partnership dissolved, should be set out as part of a financial settlement. Even when the couple agree on the settlement, it must be formally confirmed in a court order.


^How pensions are dealt with at divorce, or when a civil partnership is dissolved, is complex. You should always get legal advice, especially if you're remarrying and haven't previously agreed how your ex-partner's pension should be dealt with.^


##How courts deal with pensions

Courts deal with pensions in three ways.

###1. One partner is given a percentage share of the other partner's pension pot(s)

This is known as [pension sharing.](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/when-things-change/when-relationships-end/pension-sharing)

Under this arrangement, if you get a part of your ex-partner's pot, the money is legally yours.

###2. A pension's value is offset against other assets

This is known as [pension offsetting.](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/when-things-change/when-relationships-end/pension-offsetting)

An example of this arrangement could be one person keeping their pension and their ex-partner keeping the home.

###3. Once you take your pension money, some of it gets paid to your ex-partner

This is known as [pension attachment.](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/when-things-change/when-relationships-end/pension-earmarking). This is like a maintenance payment, paid directly from one person's pension pot to their ex-partner.

Under this arrangement, money from someone's tax-free lump sum can also go their ex-partner.


##If you live in Scotland

Broadly, courts deal with pensions in the same way as in the rest of the UK. However, some differences apply.

##Your State Pension


Your [basic State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension) canâ€™t be shared if your marriage or civil partnership ends. However, if one partner has paid enough National Insurance contributions, the State Pension that their ex-partner gets could increase.


If you have an [additional State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/additional-state-pension), the court could order that this is shared between you if your marriage or civil partnership ends. However, if one of you remarries or enters into another civil partnership, that person could lose their right to their ex-partner's State Pension.


The [new State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension) from 6 April 2016 may affect how much pension money gets paid out at the end of a marriage or civil partnership.
