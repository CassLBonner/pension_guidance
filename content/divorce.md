#If you're divorced

The way a pension is split between you and your ex-partner is set out as part of the court settlement at the end of your marriage or civil partnership.


##The three ways courts split pensions


###1. Your ex-partner is given a percentage share of one or more of your pension pots

This is known as [pension sharing.](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/when-things-change/when-relationships-end/pension-sharing)

###2. A pension's value is offset against other assets

For example, you keep all your pension money while your ex-partner keeps the home. This is known as [pension offsetting.](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/when-things-change/when-relationships-end/pension-offsetting)

###3. Once you take your pension money your provider pays some of it to your ex-partner

This is known as [pension attachment or pension earmarking.](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/when-things-change/when-relationships-end/pension-earmarking) Your ex-partner will need to wait until you start taking your pension money before they can get their payments. Also, your ex-partner can’t claim any of your pension if they remarry or have another civil partnership.


##If you live in Scotland


Different rules apply for [splitting pensions in Scotland.](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/dividing-pensions-on-divorce-or-dissolution)


In Scotland, money that your ex-partner gets from pension attachment can only be from your tax-free lump sum, not from the rest of your pension.


##Your State Pension


Your [basic State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension) can’t be split if your marriage or civil partnership ends. However, if one partner has paid enough National Insurance contributions, the State Pension that their ex-partner gets could increase.


If you have an [additional State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/additional-state-pension), the court could split this between you and your ex-partner. However, you could lose your right to your ex-partner's State Pension if you remarry or have another civil partnership.


The [new State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension) from 6 April 2016 may affect how much pension money you get after the end of your marriage or civil partnership.
