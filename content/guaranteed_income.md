# Getting a guaranteed income (annuity)

You might want to use your pension pot to buy an insurance policy that gives you a guaranteed income for the rest of your life. This is called an annuity. You can also buy an annuity for a fixed number of years.

^There are lots of different types of annuities and it’s important you get the right one for you.^

Once you’ve bought your annuity you only have a short period when you can still change your mind (in most cases 30 days). After that you can’t change the decision and your rate will be fixed.

## Types of annuity

Types of annuity you can buy include:

- ‘single life’ – paid just to you, either for life or for a fixed number of years
- ‘joint life’ – payments continue to your spouse or partner after you die
- ‘fixed term’ or ‘guaranteed period’ – stops paying at the end of the set term, eg you get a guaranteed 10 year annuity and die after 7 years, your spouse or partner still gets payments for another 3 years
- ‘enhanced’ or ‘impaired’ – may pay more than a standard annuity if you smoke or have a medical condition, eg diabetes or high blood pressure
- ‘escalating’ – the amount increases each year to reduce the effect of inflation
- ‘level’ – pays a flat amount of income each year
- ‘investment-linked’ – tied to the stock market, the amount it pays can vary and depends on the success of the investments
- ‘capital protected’ – your pot is paid to whoever you leave it to (your ‘beneficiary’) if you die within a set period, subject to tax

## Tax-free lump sums

If you decide to buy an annuity you can still take up to 25% of your pension pot tax free as cash. You could then, for example, buy the annuity with the remaining 75%. 

Under current pension rules you have to buy the annuity within 6 months or use one of the other pension options.

## How an annuity is calculated

How much income you get each year from an annuity depends on things like:

- how much you had in your pension pot when you bought the annuity
- your age
- whether you want the income to increase each year
- whether you want the annuity to pay out to someone after you die
- your health and lifestyle

You [pay tax on income from an annuity](/tax), just like you do on your salary.  You may also pay administration charges.

If the insurer you bought your annuity with goes bust the [Financial Services Compensation Scheme](http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/) will cover you in full.
