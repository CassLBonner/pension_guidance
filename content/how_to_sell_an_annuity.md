# How to sell an annuity
 
If you want to sell your annuity you need to shop around with other providers to see which offers the best value. 

You can use a broker or independent financial adviser to help you if you aren’t confident shopping around, but they may charge you.

^You may not be able to sell directly back to your current provider – this could be through a broker or someone else.^ 

## Before you sell

You should consider getting financial advice before selling. 

Legally you must get advice if your annuity pays over a certain amount a year. This amount will be set when the new rules come in.

## How much you’ll get

How much money you’ll get from selling an annuity is likely to be based, for example, on:
- your age
- the [type of annuity](/guaranteed-income#types-of-annuity), eg single life, joint life
- your health and lifestyle
- how much you currently receive from your annuity

Before a provider can tell you how much you’ll get for your annuity, they may ask for a medical report from your GP or an independent doctor.

## How you can use the money

When you sell your annuity you can take the money as a cash lump sum, or use it money from the sale you can arrange to: 

buy a different [type of annuity](/guaranteed-income#types-of-annuity)
get an [adjustable income](adjustable-income)

### Tax if you take cash

Your annuity provider will take off the tax you owe before they pay you the cash. 

The cash you take will be added to any other income you have over the tax year, eg money from work, savings and benefits.

You may pay emergency tax which you can claim back.

If your provider doesn’t pay your emergency tax back automatically, you can claim it back from HM Revenue and Customs.

### Benefits

Getting a large sum of cash from selling your annuity could affect your [entitlement to any benefits](/benefits).

%If you deliberately spend or give away money from selling your annuity to get or increase help with care costs, your local council may assess your eligibility again and treat you as still having that money.%
 
## Getting financial advice
 
An [independent financial adviser](/financial-advice) can help you decide if your best option is to keep or sell your annuity.
 
They can also:
 
- find out how much you could get for your annuity
- help you find a buyer
- help you get the best deal

^Pension Wise will offer guidance on selling an annuity when the new rules come in.^

## Dependants and beneficiaries

If you have an annuity which continues to pay an income to someone (a beneficiary) after you die you may not be able to sell it without their consent.

Ask your provider if you don’t know if your annuity has a beneficiary.

^Get advice or guidance if you’re the beneficiary of an annuity and you’re being put under pressure to give your consent.^ 

## Joint annuities

If you have a [joint annuity](/guaranteed-income#types-of-annuity), you may not be able to sell it without the agreement of the other person.

## Scams

Beware of [pension scams](https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/scams) contacting you unexpectedly about selling your annuity. You could lose all your money and pay high amounts of tax and extra fees.

^Get advice or guidance if someone is putting you under pressure to sell your annuity – even if it’s a family member.^

## Paying off debt

You should get advice if you’re thinking of selling your annuity to pay off debts.

The [Money Advice Service](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en) and [Citizens Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) both offer free and impartial debt advice.
