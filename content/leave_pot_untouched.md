# Leave your whole pension pot untouched

## Overview

You don’t have to start taking money from your pension pot when you reach your ‘selected retirement age’ (the age you agreed with your provider to retire). You could leave the money invested, eg while you’re working.

- The money in your pot could grow.
- You could have more money to last a shorter length of time.
- You (and your employer) can also still pay into your pot but there may be restrictions.

## Tax

You don’t pay tax while the money stays in your pot. You can still pay into it up to your [annual allowance](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/annual-allowance).

Money you leave in your pot can be [passed on](/when-you-die) tax free if you die before the age of 75.

## Fees and investment risk

Your provider may charge you administration fees for managing your pot.

As with every investment the value of your pot could go up or down.

%Your provider may charge you a penalty fee if you don’t start taking your pension when you reach your selected retirement age.%

## Scams

If someone contacts you unexpectedly about getting money out of your pot before you’re 55, it’s nearly always a pension scam.

## Next steps

Ask your pension provider the following questions:

- What are your fees for leaving my money in longer?
- Do I have to take the money by a certain date and are there penalty fees if I don’t?
- How much is the pot likely to grow each year?
- How is the money invested and can I change this if I want?
- How much can I still pay in?
- Does my pot have any special features that could mean I get a better deal, eg a guaranteed annuity rate?
- Do you have up-to-date details of the person I want to leave my pot to (my ‘beneficiary’)?
