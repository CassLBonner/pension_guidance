#Living abroad and your pension

If you’re planning on moving abroad and have a defined contribution pension - a pension based on how much money has been paid into your pot - you have two choices about what to do with it.

You can either:


* leave your pot in the UK - once you're 55 you'll have the same choices about [what to do with your pension pot](/pension-pot-options) as if you live in the UK
* [transfer your pension abroad](https://www.gov.uk/transferring-your-pension/transferring-to-an-overseas-pension-scheme)



You have the same choices if you’re already living abroad and have a UK defined contribution pension.

If you have more than one UK defined contribution pension you can mix your options, eg leave one pension in the UK and transfer another overseas.


^Remember to check with your pension provider about what happens to your pension if you move abroad or transfer it overseas.^


##Transferring your pension overseas


Transferring your pension overseas could:


* mean you have less choice about what you can do with your pension pot than if you left it in the UK
* affect the amount of pension you get at retirement
* affect how much tax you pay on your pension
* mean you have to pay more charges


If you transfer your pension, make sure that you move it to one of the [qualifying recognised overseas pensions schemes](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-qualifying-recognised-overseas-pension-schemes-qrops). These are schemes that meet the same standards as those in the UK.


##Taking your pension money when you live abroad

You can have your pension money paid into a UK bank account. Check with your bank about what charges may apply, eg:


* if you take out your money abroad using a debit card
* if you transfer your pension money to another account


UK pension providers don't usually pay your pension straight into an overseas bank account. If they do, they may charge you. The exchange rate between the UK and the country you move to can also affect how much money you get.


##Don’t forget about tax


You must tell HM Revenue and Customs if you [plan to retire abroad](https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad) so that you pay the right tax on your pension. The amount of tax you pay and which country you pay tax to depend on many things.

If you move abroad before you start taking your pension, the tax law in the country you move to may prevent you from taking anything tax free.
