#Plan how long your money needs to last

Knowing how long your money needs to last depends on when you want to start taking it and what your future plans are. For example, you may wish to continue working when you reach [State Pension age](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension/y/age) or after the retirement date on your pension.

You could decide to leave your money invested and continue paying into your pot - this may give you more money to live off in the future over a shorter period of time. 

You might have less in retirement because your income may be lower than it was when in full-time work. 

##How long your money needs to last 

People are living longer. On average, people aged 55 today will live to their mid-to-late 80s. Around 1 in 10 men and 1 in 5 women will live to 100. (Source: the Office of National Statistics). 

Lifestyle choices and other factors may affect how long you live. You’ll need to think about how to make the money you’ve got last for the rest of your lifetime.

%Taking too much of your pension money in early retirement could mean you don’t have enough for later.%

You’ll also need to decide when to take your State Pension once you reach State Pension age.

You can’t take the State Pension early but you can push back when you start receiving it - this is called [deferring the State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/deferring-state-pension/what-you-may-get).

You can also [top up your State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/statepensiontopup) if you don’t get the full amount. 

##When to start taking your pension money

When you choose to take your money is up to you. Don’t rush your decision.

You might want to continue working for a while, possibly part time. Many employers offer [flexible working arrangements](https://www.gov.uk/flexible-working) for people close to or over retirement age.

Your future plans may include stopping working altogether and travelling in your late 60s and 70s. You may then look to spend more time at home in your 80s when you may be less active. It’s possible you’ll need more income in your later years, eg to cover [care costs](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/planning-for-your-future-care-needs.aspx).

You’ll need to work out if you’re able to spread your pension money across these stages of retirement.

^To help you decide when to start taking your pension you’ll first need to [work out your total retirement income](/work-out-income), eg any of other savings, or benefits you’re entitled to. This will give you a basic idea of how much money you’ll have in retirement.^

##Your retirement age and date

Most pensions set the age at which you’re expected to take the money from your pension pot, eg when you turn 65.

This is known as your ‘selected retirement date’ and may be different to your State Pension age.

You don’t have to take your money when you reach this date. You can leave your pension pot untouched until you’re ready to take from it. At this point you’ll need to decide how to take the money from your pot.

The longer you leave the money invested and continue to pay into it, the higher your income could be when you choose to take it. You also don’t [pay Income Tax](/tax) on the money for as long as it stays in your pot.

You may wish to speak to a [financial adviser](/shop-around#getting-financial-advice) to help you decide which pension pot option to choose and when.

^Many people can’t afford to retire before their selected retirement date. Retiring early is likely to leave you with a lower retirement income.^

##Finding out your retirement date

Your selected retirement date could influence when you decide to take the money from your pension pot.

Find out what age and date you’ve said you want to retire at. Check your pension paperwork, eg your annual pension statements. If you still can’t find this information ask your pension provider.

Ask if there’s a charge to change this date, or if doing so changes the terms of your pension. Some providers have rules that kick in if you retire earlier or later than your selected retirement date.

##Budget for retirement

Your income and spending patterns are likely to change when you retire, eg you may have less income from work but more money from having paid off your mortgage.

Once you know how much money you’ll have you’ll need to plan how it’ll be spent. Your main costs are likely to include:

- rent or mortgage (if not paid off)
- energy and household bills
- food and living costs
- care costs in later life

Use the [Money Advice Service Budget planner](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/budget-planner) to work out how much your expenses will be in retirement.

##How your income will change

Your income in retirement will be influenced by what you choose to do with your pension pot.

You’ll need to think about what’s important to you in terms of security and flexibility. An annuity can provide you with a guaranteed level of income. This is similar to defined benefit pensions and the basic State Pension but different from flexi-access drawdown products which are more flexible.

With cash and flexi-access drawdown, where part or all of your pot remains invested, your pot will only stay the same (or increase) if you take out as much or less than the amount it grows.

Your [basic State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/overview) amount will increase each year.
