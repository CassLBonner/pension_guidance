#Plan how long your money needs to last

Knowing how long your money needs to last depends on when you want to start taking it and what your future plans are.

For example, you may wish to continue working when you reach [State Pension age](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension) or after the retirement date on your private pension.

You could decide to leave your money invested and keep paying into your pot - this may give you more money to live off in the future over a shorter period of time.

It’s likely you'll have less in retirement because your income won't match your salary when in full-time work. You’ll need to think about how to make the money you've got last for 20 years or more.

%Taking too much of your pension money in early retirement could mean you don’t have enough for later.%

You’ll also need to decide [when to take your State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/deferring-state-pension/what-you-may-get) once you reach State Pension age.

##When to start taking your pension money

When you choose to take your money is up to you. Don’t make a rush decision.

Your future plans may include cutting back on work and travelling in your 60s. This could mean you need more money at the beginning of your retirement to help fund your spending.

You may then look to spend more time at home in your 80s when you’ve stopped working and may be less active. It’s possible you’ll need more income in your later years, eg to cover health and care costs.

You’ll need to work out if you’re able to spread your pension money across these stages of retirement.

^To help you decide when to start taking your pension you’ll first need to calculate your retirement income. This will give you a basic idea of how much money you’ll have in retirement.^

##Your retirement age and date

Most pension schemes set the age at which you're expected to take the money from your pension pot, eg when you turn 65.

This is known as your selected retirement date and may be different to your State Pension age.

You don’t have to take your money when you reach this date. You can leave your pension pot untouched until you’re ready to take from it. At this point you’ll need to decide how to take the money from your pot.

The longer you leave the money invested and continue to pay into it, the higher your income could be when you choose to take it.

You may wish to speak to a financial adviser to help you decide which pension pot option to choose and when.

^Most people can't afford to retire before their selected retirement date. Retiring early is likely to leave you with a lower retirement income.^

##Find out your retirement date

Your selected retirement date could influence when you decide to take the money from your pension pot.

Find out what age and date you’ve said you want to retire at. Check your pension paperwork, eg your annual pension statements. If you still can’t find this information ask your pension provider.

Ask if is there’s a charge to change this date, or if doing so changes the terms of your pension. Some providers have rules that kick in if you retire earlier or later than your selected retirement date.

Check your State Pension age. You can’t take the State Pension early but you can push back when you start receiving it - this is called deferring the State Pension.

##Budget for retirement

Your income and spending patterns are likely to change when you retire, eg you may have less income from work but more income from having paid off your mortgage.

Once you know how much money you’ll have you’ll need to plan how it’ll be spent. Your main costs are likely to include:

- mortgage (if not paid off)
- energy bills
- food and living costs
- care and health costs in later life

##How your income will change

Your income in retirement will be influenced by what you choose to do with your pension pot.

You’ll need to think about what’s important to you in terms of security and flexibility. An annuity will provide you with a secure income for life, as does a defined benefit pension and the basic State Pension.

With cash and income drawdown, where part or all of your pot remains invested, your pot will only stay the same (or increase) if you take out as much or less than the amount it grows.

Your [basic State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/overview) amount will increase each year.
