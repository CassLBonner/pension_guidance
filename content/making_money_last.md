# Increase your retirement income

If you don’t think you’ll have enough money to last through your retirement you could increase it by:

- paying more into your pot now
- taking your pot later
- delaying when you take the State Pension

## Pay more into your pot now

You get [tax relief](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/pension-tax-relief) on any money you pay into your pot up to £40,000 a year – your [annual allowance](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/annual-allowance). 

Your allowance changes once you start taking money. It drops to £10,000 a year for any pots you take money from. 

If you have more than one pot, you can carry on paying into one after you start taking money from another.

## Take your pot later

You don't have to start taking your money at the age you agreed with your provider (your 'selected retirement age'). You may be able to [leave your pot untouched](/leave-pot-untouched). Your provider may charge extra fees to do this.

The longer you leave your money invested and continue to pay in, the higher your income could be when you come to take it.

You might want to continue working for a while, possibly part time. Many employers offer [flexible working](https://www.gov.uk/flexible-working) for people close to or over retirement age.

## Delay the State Pension

You can delay when you get the State Pension to help increase your income in retirement. This is called [deferring the State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/deferring-state-pension/what-you-may-get).

You may be able to [top up your State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/statepensiontopup) if you’re:

- a man born before 6 April 1951
- a woman born before 6 April 1953
