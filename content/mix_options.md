# Mixing your pension options

You can mix your options but not all providers offer all the options.

You could do this at different times in your retirement. For example, you can take some cash from your pot first and buy an annuity later.

## Getting financial advice
Mixing your options can be complicated. If you’re interested in this you might want to talk to a financial adviser first to check what’s currently available.

Pension providers are developing new retirement income products all the time, some of which might mix these options.

**Example**

Your pension pot is £60,000. You decide to take 25% as tax-free cash which is £15,000.

{: .example__guaranteed-income}
You use £20,000 to buy an annuity. This gives you a taxable income for the rest of your life of about £900 a year.

{: .example__adjustable-income}
You also put £25,000 into a drawdown fund to get an adjustable income and take out about £5,000 a year for about 5 years.
