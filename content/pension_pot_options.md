#What you can do with your pension pot

You can decide how to take the money from your pension pot when you retire. It doesn’t matter if your pot comes from a private pension you set up yourself, a workplace pension you paid into, or both.

You can usually take 25% of your [defined contribution pension](/pension-types) pot tax free.

The remaining 75% you can take as:

- an annuity - you buy an insurance policy that gives you an income for the rest of your life
- flexible income - your pot stays invested while you take money from it
- cash - you take your whole pot in one go

You can also mix some of these options. You don't have to put all the money from your pot into these options. You can leave part of it untouched. Your pension provider might offer other options in the future.

^Not all pension schemes offer all options. You don't have to stay with the scheme you paid into. You can shop around to find the offer that best suits you.^

##Leave your pension pot untouched

You don't have to start taking money from your pension pot when you reach your 'selected retirement age' (the pension age you agreed with your provider). You can leave the money invested, eg while you're working. Your provider may charge you administration fees for managing the fund.

As long as your money stays in your pension pot you don't pay tax on it. You can still pay into it up to your [annual allowance](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/annual-allowance).

Your pension pot could grow further and give you a larger amount of money to last for a shorter amount of time. Whatever money you leave in your pension pot you can pass on tax free if you die before the age of 75.

As with every investment the value of your pot could go up or down.

Usually the earliest you can start taking money from your pot is 55. Check with your provider. In some circumstances you can [take your pension earlier](https://www.gov.uk/early-retirement-pension/personal-and-workplace-pensions).

###Your next steps

If you want to leave your pot untouched for a while, ask your pension provider:


- what they're charging you for managing your pension money
- if their charges will change in the future - pushing them for accurate information about charges will help you if you want to [shop around](/shop-around) for other providers
- if you have to take your pension money by a specific date or age
- if you can keep on paying in - if so, ask if there are any limits
- how much your pension pot is likely to grow by, over the number of years you're planning on leaving it untouched
- if your pension pot has any special arrangements that could affect when you take your pension money, eg a guaranteed value at a certain date
- how your money is being invested now and in the future - if you want to make any changes to how your money's invested, [get financial advice](/shop-around#getting-financial-advice) before making a decision
- if they have up-to-date details of the person who you want to leave your money to when you die - let your provider know if you need to make any changes


##Get a guaranteed income (annuity)

You might want to use your pension pot to buy an insurance policy that gives you a guaranteed income for the rest of your life. This is called an annuity. You can also buy an annuity for a fixed number of years.

^There are lots of different types of annuities - make sure you buy the right one for you.^

Once you've bought your annuity you only have a short period when you can still change your mind (in most cases 30 days). After that you can't change the decision and your rate will be fixed.

###Types of annuities

There are different types of annuities you can buy:

- single - only you get paid an income either for life or for a fixed number of years
- joint - payments continue to your spouse/partner after you die
- guaranteed period - you fix the number of years where payments to your spouse/partner continue after you die (sometimes this can be a lump sum), the guaranteed period starts the day you take money from your pot, for example you take a guaranteed 10 year annuity and die after 8 years, your spouse/partner gets payments for another 2 years
- escalating - increases every year to reduce the effect of inflation
- enhanced - if your health is bad you may get more money from your annuity

###Tax-free lump sum with annuities

If you decide to buy an annuity you can still take 25% of your pension pot tax free as cash. You could then, for example, buy the annuity with the remaining 75%. Under current pension rules you have to buy the annuity within 6 months or alternatively use one of the other options on this page.

###How an annuity is calculated

How much income you get each year from an annuity depends on things like:

- how much you had in your pension pot when you bought the annuity
- your age
- whether you want the income to increase each year
- whether you want the annuity to pay out to someone after you die
- your health and lifestyle

You [pay tax on income from an annuity](/tax), just like you do on your salary.  You may also pay administration charges.

If the insurer you bought your annuity with goes bust you'll be covered for 90% by the [Financial Services Compensation Scheme](http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/).


###Your next steps

If you’re interested in buying an annuity you can:

- [compare annuities](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/annuities) to check how much you might get
- [shop around](/shop-around) for the best deal - you don’t have to stay with your current provider
- make sure you know [how much tax you'll pay](/tax) on your annuity income
- check with your provider if the annuity they offer is right for you, eg if you're in poor health you could get a better rate
- ask your provider if your pension pot has any special arrangements, eg a guaranteed annuity rate


##Get a flexible income

There are currently 2 ways you can get a flexible income from your pension pot. The main difference is how you can take the tax-free part:

- flexi-access drawdown - you can take 25% of your whole pot in one go
- take smaller cash sums - you can get 25% tax free each time you take money from your pot

###Option 1: Flexi-access drawdown
Like an annuity, you buy a ‘retirement product’ from a pension provider. This includes investing your pension pot into flexi-access drawdown funds and managing these funds. Not all providers offer this. If they do, they may charge you for this service.

It’s up to you where your money is invested. Your provider will give you some options for different funds. If you want independent advice you might want to talk to a [financial adviser](/shop-around#getting-financial-advice) to help you with this.

As with every investment there's the risk that the value of your fund can go up or down.

You can take as much money as you want as often as you want. You may have to pay a charge each time you withdraw money. Your provider will pay the money to you after having taken off any [Income Tax](/tax) due. You should think about how much you want to take out each year and how long you want your money to last.

%Taking out larger sums can mean you pay more tax.%

You can leave your pot to someone when you die but they may have to [pay tax on it](/when-you-die).

If the pension provider your fund is with goes bust you'll be covered by the [Financial Services Compensation Scheme](http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/).

You could also still pay into the fund if you wanted to, up to a limit of £10,000 a year. This includes your tax relief of 20%. For example, to get a contribution of £10,000 you would only have to pay in £8,000.

###Tax free lump sum with flexi-access drawdown
You can take 25% of your whole pot tax free in one go before you put the rest into a flexi-access drawdown fund.

$E
**Example**
You have a pot of £80,000 and take a tax-free lump sum of £20,000. This leaves you with £60,000 to invest into flexi-access.
$E

If you take the tax-free lump sum, under current pension rules you must buy your flexi-access product within 6 months or use one of the other options on this page.

Alternatively, you can move your pot gradually into flexi-access - you don't have to move it all at once. Each time you move an amount you can take 25% tax free.

###Your next steps

If you’re interested in flexi-access drawdown you can:

- get some estimates from [registered providers](http://www.fca.org.uk/register) on how much your investments could grow and what the charges are - usually you just have to fill in a short form on a provider's website
- [shop around](/shop-around) for the best deal - you don’t have to stay with your current provider
- check with providers what kind of flexi-access drawdown they offer, some might have products where part of your income is guaranteed but charges and conditions will apply
- make sure you know [how much tax you'll pay](/tax)

###Option 2: Take smaller cash sums from your pot

You can leave your money in your current pension pot and take money from it when you need it. How often you take money out and how much is up to you - 25% of each sum you take is tax free.

However, this means you can’t take the whole 25% tax-free lump sum from your pot in one go.

This option is a bit like a savings account. Not all providers offer it. You may have to pay administration charges each time you withdraw money.

$E
**Example**
Your pot is £60,000. You take £1,000 out as cash every month - £250 of this amount would be tax-free every time. The remaining £750 would be taxable.
$E

As with every investment there's the risk that the value of your fund can go up or down. You should think about how much you take out every year and how long you want your money to last.

%Taking out larger sums can mean you pay more tax.%

You could also still pay into the fund if you wanted to, up to a limit of £10,000 a year. This includes your tax relief of 20%. For example, to get a contribution of £10,000 you would only have to pay in £8,000.

###Your next steps

If you’re interested in taking smaller cash sums from your pot you can:

- check with your provider if they offer this option and what they charge
- calculate how much you'll take out over the year and how long your pot might last
- make sure you know [how much tax you'll pay](/tax)
- ask your provider if your pension pot has any special arrangements that could affect when you take your pension money, eg a guaranteed value at a certain date


##Take your whole pot as cash

If you take your whole pension pot in one go - 25% is tax-free and the remaining [75% is taxable](/tax).

$E
**Example**
Your pot is £60,000.
You can take £15,000 tax-free.
The remaining £45,000 would be taxable.
$E

If you’re considering this option you should think about how you can use the money to give you an income in retirement.

%Taking a large sum of cash from your pension pot can mean you pay more tax.%

###What you can do next

Here are some next steps if you're interested in cashing in your whole pot:

- check with your provider if you can take 25% tax free
- make sure you know [how much tax you'll pay](/tax) on the remaining 75%
- if you want to reinvest the money, talk to a [registered financial adviser](http://www.fca.org.uk/register) first

##Mix your pension options
You can mix your options but not all providers offer all the options mentioned here. Mixing your options can be complicated. If you're interested in this you might want to talk to a financial adviser first to check what's currently available.

You can mix your options at different times in your retirement. For example, you can take some cash from your pot first and buy an annuity later.

Pension providers are developing new retirement income products all the time, some of which might mix these options.

$E
**Example**

Your pension pot is £60,000. You decide to take 25% as tax-free cash which is £15,000.

You use £20,000 to buy an annuity. This gives you a taxable income for the rest of your life of about £900 a year.

You also put £25,000 into a drawdown fund and take out about £5,000 a year for about 5 years.
$E


###Your next steps

If you're interested in mixing your options:

- look at all options to see which ones are right for you
- shop around - you don't have to buy a product from your current provider
- [get financial advice](/shop-around#getting-financial-advice) before making a decision
