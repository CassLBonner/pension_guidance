# What you can do with your pension pot

You can decide how to take money from your pension pot when you retire.

You have 5 options:

## [Leave your pot untouched](/leave-pot-untouched)
You don’t have to start taking money from your pension pot when you reach your ‘selected retirement age’. You can leave your money invested in your pot until you need it.

## [Guaranteed income (annuity)](/guaranteed-income)
You use your pot to buy an insurance policy that guarantees you an income for the rest of your life - no matter how long you live.

## [Adjustable income](/adjustable-income)
Your pot is invested to give you a regular income. You decide how much to take out and when, and how long you want it to last.

## [Take cash](/take-cash)
You can take cash in chunks until your pot runs out, or take your whole pot in one go.

## [Mix your options](/mix-options)
You can mix different options. Usually, you would need a bigger pot to do this.
