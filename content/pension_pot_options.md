#What you can do with your pension pot

You can decide how to take the money from your pension pot when you retire. It doesn’t matter if your pot comes from a private pension you set up yourself, a workplace pension you paid into, or both.

You can usually take 25% of your [defined contribution pension](/articles//know-your-pension-type) pot tax free.

The remaining 75% you can take as:

- an annuity - you buy an insurance policy that gives you an income for the rest of your life
- income drawdown - your pot stays invested while you take money from it
- cash

You can also mix these 3 options. You don't have to put all the money from your pot into these options. You can leave part of it untouched.

^Not all pension providers offer all options. You don't have to stay with your current provider. You can shop around to find the offer that best suits you.^

##Leave your pension pot untouched

When you reach retirement age you don’t automatically have to start taking money from your pension pot. You can leave the money invested and also continue to pay into your pot.

As long as your money stays in your pension pot you don't pay tax on it.

Your pension pot could grow further and give you a larger amount of money to last for a shorter amount of time. It will also give you more time to think about your pension options and how best you can use the money in the future.

Whatever money you leave in your pension pot you can pass on tax free if you die before the age of 75.

Usually the earliest you can start taking money from your pot is 55.

###What you can do next

Here are some next steps if you want to leave your pot untouched for a while:

- decide how long you want to leave your pot
- ask your provider for an estimate of how much your pot could grow
- tell your provider you still want to pay into your pot


##Get a guaranteed income (annuity)

You can use your pension pot to buy a guaranteed income for the rest of your life. This is called an annuity. It normally guarantees you a regular income until you die.

You can also buy an annuity for a fixed number of years.

Once you've bought your annuity you only have a short period when you can still change your mind (in most cases 30 days). After that you can't change the decision.

^You don’t have to use your whole pension pot to buy an annuity. You can mix your options.^

###Tax-free lump sum with annuities

If you decide to buy an annuity you can still take 25% of your pension pot tax free as cash. You could then, for example, buy the annuity with the remaining 75%. You would have to buy the annuity within 6 months or alternatively use one of the other options on this page.

###How an annuity is calculated

How much income you get each year from an annuity depends on things like:

- how much you had in your pension pot when you bought the annuity
- your age
- whether you want the income to increase each year
- whether you want the annuity to pay out to someone after you die
- your health and lifestyle

You [pay tax on income from an annuity](/tax), just like you do on your salary.  You also pay administration charges. These will be included in the payments from your provider. If you use a financial adviser they'll deduct them separately.


###Types of annuities

There are different types of annuities you can buy:

- single - only you get paid an income either for life or for a fixed number of years
- joint - payments continue to your spouse/partner after you die
- guaranteed period - you fix the number of years where payments to your spouse/partner continue after you die, the guaranteed period starts the day you take money from your pot, for example you take a guaranteed 10 year annuity and die after 8 years, your spouse/partner gets payments for another 2 years
- escalating - increases every year to reduce the effect of inflation
- enhanced - if your health is bad you can get more money from your annuity

###What you can do next

Here are some next steps if you're interested in buying an annuity:

- [compare annuities](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/annuities) to check how much you might get
- [shop around](/shop-around) for the best deal - you don’t have to stay with your current provider
- make sure you know [how much tax you'll pay](/tax) on your annuity payments

##Get a flexible income (income drawdown)

You can move your pension pot into one or more funds that allow you to take money out when you need it. This is called 'flexi-access drawdown'. You should talk to a financial adviser if you're interested in this.

###Tax-free lump sum with income drawdown

With income drawdown you can still take 25% of your pension pot tax free. For example, you have a pot of £80,000 and take a tax-free lump sum of £20,000. This leaves you with £60,000 to invest into income drawdown.

If you take the tax-free lump sum you must put the remaining 75% into income drawdown within 6 months or use one of the other options on this page.

###How income drawdown works
The money gets invested in income drawdown funds and could still grow, depending on how well your investments do. As with every investment there is the risk that your fund can go up or down.

Where your money is invested is up to you. You can use a financial adviser to advise you, or decide yourself.

You then tell your provider when you need your money and how much you want. They’ll pay it to you after having taken off any [Income Tax](/tax) due.

With income drawdown you can continue to pay more money into your pension pot.

You can move your pot gradually into drawdown - you don't have to move it all at once. Each time you move an amount you can take 25% of tax free.

You also pay charges to your provider to run the income drawdown fund for you.

###What you can do next

Here are some next steps if you're interested in income drawdown:

- get some estimates from [registered providers](http://www.fsa.gov.uk/register/home.do) of how much you would get - usually you just have to fill in a short form on a provider's website
- [shop around](/shop-around) for the best deal - you don’t have to stay with your current provider
- make sure you know [how much tax you'll pay](/tax) on

##Take your whole pot as cash

If you take your whole pension pot in one go, 25% is tax-free and the remaining [75% is taxable](/articles/tax).

$E
**Example**
Your pot is £60,000.
You can take £15,000 tax-free.
The remaining £45,000 would be taxable.
$E

If you’re considering this option you should think about how you can use the money to give you an income in retirement.

%Taking a large sum of cash from your pension pot can bump you into a higher tax rate.%

###What you can do next

Here are some next steps if you're interested in cashing in your whole pot:

- check with your provider if you can take 25% tax free
- make sure you know [how much tax you'll pay](/tax) on the remaining 75%
- if you want to reinvest the money, talk to a [registered financial adviser](http://www.fsa.gov.uk/register/home.do) first

##Take smaller cash sums from your pot

You can take smaller sums from your pot - 25% of each sum is tax free.

$E
**Example**
Your pot is £60,000. You take £1,000 out as cash every month - £250 of this amount would be tax-free every time. The remaining £750 would be taxable.
$E

With this option you leave your money in your pension pot. You could also still pay into it up to a limit of £10,000 a year. This option is a bit like a savings account. Check with your provider if they offer it.

Like with every investment there's the risk that the value of your pot can go up or down, depending on the market.

You have to pay administration charges to your pension provider.

###What you can do next

Here are some next steps if you're interested in smaller cash sums from your pot:

- check with your provider if they offer this option
- calculate how much you'll take out over the year and how long your pot might last
- make sure you know [how much tax you'll pay](/tax) on your pension payments

##Mix your pension options
You can mix your options but not all providers offer all the options mentioned here. If you're interested in this you might want to talk to a financial adviser first to check what's currently available.

You can mix your options at different times in your retirement. For example, you can take some cash from your pot first and buy an annuity later.

Pension providers are developing new retirement income products all the time, some of which might mix these options. It's therefore likely that you'll have more options to choose from in the future.



$E
**Example**

Your pension pot is £60,000. You decide to take 25% as tax-free cash which is £15,000.

You use £20,000 to buy an annuity. This gives you a taxable income for the rest of your life of about £900 a year.

You also put £25,000 into a drawdown fund and take out about £5,000 a year for about 5 years.
