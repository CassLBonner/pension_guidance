#Check the value of your pension pot

If you’re unsure how much you’ve got in your whole pension pot, or how many pots you’ve paid into, there are different ways to find out.

You can:

- look at your pension statement - your provider should send you this once a year
- online - many providers let you track your pension on their website 
- look at your ‘wake-up’ pack - you get this from your pension provider between 4 and 6 months before your agreed pension age (‘selected retirement age’) which is usually between 60 and 65
- contact your pension provider(s)

If you’re less than 4 months away from your pension age and haven’t yet received a wake-up pack you should contact your pension provider.

You may have paid into more than one pension pot. You’ll need to contact each pension provider to find out the value of each one.

##Combine your pension pots

You can combine multiple pension pots into one by [transferring your pension](https://www.gov.uk/transferring-your-pension/transferring-to-a-uk-pension-scheme). You might save on administration charges but there could be fees and you could lose certain arrangements you have with your current provider. You may wish to get [financial advice](/shop-around#getting-financial-advice) before doing this.

##Check which pensions you’ve paid into

If you can’t remember which pensions you paid into you can [find a lost pension](https://www.gov.uk/find-lost-pension).
