#Check the value of your pension pot

If you’re unsure how much you’ve got in your whole pension pot, or how many pots you’ve paid into, there are different ways to find out.

You can:

- look at your pension statement - your provider should send you this once a year
- look at your ‘wake-up' pack - this is the pack you got from your pension provider between 4 and 6 months before your agreed retirement age (usually between 60 and 65)
- contact your pension provider(s)

If you’re less than 4 months away from your retirement age and haven’t yet received a wake-up pack you should contact your pension provider.

You may have paid into more than one pension pot. You’ll need to contact each pension provider to find out the value of each one.

##Check which pensions you’ve paid into
