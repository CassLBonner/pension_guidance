# Find out your pension type

Check which type of pension you have – this will help you find out if you can have a Pension Wise appointment.

In an appointment you’ll get free guidance from a pensions specialist on how you can take money from your pension pot.

You can speak to us over the phone or face to face somewhere local to you.

^You’ll need to check each pension separately if you have more than one.^
