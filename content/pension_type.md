# Find out your pension type

You can use this service to:

- check your pension type
- find out if you can book a Pension Wise appointment

You choose how to take your money if you have a defined contribution (personal or workplace) pension – you can then get free guidance about this from one of our pensions specialists.

^You’ll need to check each pension separately if you have more than one.^
