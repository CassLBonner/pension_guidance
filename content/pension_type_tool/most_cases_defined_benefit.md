# Find out your pension type

## In most cases you’ll have a defined benefit pension

Pension Wise only gives guidance on defined contribution pensions.

For guidance on defined benefit pensions go to the [The Pensions Advisory Service](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk) or the [Pensions Service](https://www.gov.uk/contact-pension-service) for the State Pension.

^If you have more than one pension, you may also have a defined contribution pension – [check another pension](/pension-type-tool).^
