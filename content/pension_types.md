# Know your pension type

^Pension Wise only provides guidance on what you can do with a defined contribution pension.^

Along with the State Pension from the government, there are 2 main types of pension.

## Defined contribution

This can be a personal or workplace pension and is based on how much money has been paid into your pot. They’re sometimes known as ‘money purchase’ schemes.

When you take money from a defined contribution pension it comes from the money you (and sometimes your employer) saved into it over the years, plus any investment returns your money may have earned.

With defined contribution pensions, you can decide how you take your money out.

### Types of defined contribution pension

These include:

- Executive pension plan
- Group personal pension
- Master trust pension (eg NEST, NOW pension, the People’s Pension)
- SIPP (Self Invested Personal Pension)
- SSAS (Small Self Administered Schemes)
- Stakeholder pension

## Final salary or career average (defined benefit)

This is always a type of workplace pension. They give you an income based on your salary, length of service and a calculation made under the rules of your pension scheme.

The official term for these pension types is ‘defined benefit’.

With final salary or career average pensions, your employer guarantees a certain amount each year when you retire.

## When you can take your money

You can normally start taking money from a defined contribution pension from the age of 55. This is subject to the rules of your pension scheme.

Check with your provider. In some circumstances you can take your pension earlier.

## The State Pension

The pension you get from the government is called the State Pension. You get it when you reach [State Pension age](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension/y/age).

The most you can currently get from the basic State Pension is £115.95. You don’t normally get it automatically - you have to [claim the State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/how-to-claim).

If you reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016 you’ll get the [new State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension).
