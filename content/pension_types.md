#Know your pension type

You can get a pension from personal or workplace schemes you pay into and the government.

Along with the State Pension, there are 2 main types of pension.

##Defined contribution

A personal or workplace pension based on how much money has been paid into your pot.

When you take money from a defined contribution pension you get back the money you (and sometimes your employer) saved into it over the years, plus any investment returns your money earned.

##Defined benefit

A type of workplace pension based on your salary and length of time with your employer.

A defined benefit pension gives you an income based on your salary, length of service and a calculation by your employer.

With defined contribution pensions, you decide how you take your pension money - with defined benefit pensions, your employer gives you a certain amount each year when you retire.

^Pension Wise only provides guidance on what you can do with your defined contribution pension.^

##The State Pension

The pension you get from the government is called the State Pension. You get it when you reach [State Pension age](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension).

The most you can currently get from the basic State Pension is £113.10 per week. You don’t normally get it automatically - you have to [claim the State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/how-to-claim).

If you reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016 you’ll get the [new State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension).

##How much you get from each pension type

For most defined contribution pensions, how much you get depends on:

- the amount you’ve paid in
- the length of time the money’s invested
- how well the pension fund’s investments have done

For defined benefit pensions, how much you get depends on:

- the number of years you’ve worked for the employer
- your salary (this could be your final salary or your average salary across your career with the employer)
- a formula used by your employer to calculate your retirement income

##When you can take your pension money

You don’t have to retire to take money from your pension. You can normally start doing this from the age of 55.

This is when you can [choose how you take your money](/what-you-can-do-with-your-pension-pot) to help provide you with an income throughout your retirement.
