#Know your pension type

^Pension Wise only provides guidance on what you can do with a defined contribution pension - you can get help with defined benefit pensions at [The Pensions Advisory Service](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk)^

Along with the State Pension from the government, there are 2 main types of pension.

##Defined contribution

A personal or workplace pension based on how much money has been paid into your pot. Also known as 'money purchase' schemes.

When you take money from a defined contribution pension it comes from the money you (and sometimes your employer) saved into it over the years, plus any investment returns your money may have earned.

There is no guaranteed minimum - you could get back less than the amount paid in.

##Defined benefit

A type of workplace pension based on your salary and length of time with your employer. Also known as 'final salary' pensions.

A defined benefit pension gives you an income based on your salary, length of service and a calculation made under the rules of your pension scheme.

^With defined contribution pensions, you can decide how you take your money out - with defined benefit pensions, your employer guarantees a certain amount each year when you retire.

##The State Pension

The pension you get from the government is called the State Pension. You get it when you reach [State Pension age](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension/y/age).

The most you can currently get from the basic State Pension is £113.10 per week, rising to £115.95 in April 2015. You don’t normally get it automatically - you have to [claim the State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/how-to-claim).

If you reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016 you’ll get the [new State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension).

##How much you get from each pension type

For most defined contribution pensions, how much you get depends on:

- the amount you’ve paid in
- the length of time the money has been invested
- how well the investments bought with the money have done

For defined benefit pensions, how much you get depends on:

- the number of years you’ve worked for the employer
- your salary (this could be your final salary or your average salary across your career with the employer)
- a calculation made under the rules of your pension scheme

##When you can take your money

You can normally start taking money from a defined contribution pension from the age of 55. This is subject to the rules of your pension scheme.

Check with your provider. In some circumstances you can [take your pension earlier](https://www.gov.uk/early-retirement-pension/personal-and-workplace-pensions).
