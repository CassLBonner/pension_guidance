# How your pension is protected

If your provider is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) you can claim compensation for non-payments from the [Financial Services Compensation Scheme](http://www.fscs.org.uk/) (FSCS).

The limits for compensation are:

- personal pensions with an authorised insurance company - 90% of your pot’s value
- most defined contribution workplace pensions with an authorised insurance company - 90% of your pot’s value
- Self-Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPS) - different compensation limits depending on the type of SIPP, talk to your provider to find out what compensation cover you have

Once you’ve taken money out of your pot you can claim for:

- money in an account with a bank, building society or credit union - up to £85,000
- investments - up to £50,000
- annuities with an authorised insurance company - 90% of your pot’s value
