# How your pension is protected

How your pension is protected depends on your pension type.

## Defined contribution

If your employer goes out of business you won't lose your pension pot. This is because defined contribution pensions are usually run by pension providers, not employers.

^Some defined contribution pensions are run by a trust chosen by the employer. Contact your employer for exact compensation details.^

## If your provider can't pay

You can be compensated for up to 100% of the value of your pot if your pension provider is authorised by the FCA and can't pay you.

You can claim compensation from the [Financial Services Compensation Scheme](http://www.fscs.org.uk/) (FSCS).

## Defined benefit

These pensions are usually protect by the [Pension Protection Fund](http://www.pensionprotectionfund.org.uk/).

You'll usually receive:

- 100% compensation if you've reached your 'selected retirement age' (the age you agreed with your pension provider to retire)
- 90% compensation if you're below your selected retirement age

## Annuities

You can claim for 100% of your pot’s value if your annuity provider can no longer pay your annuity. Your provider must be authorised by the FCA.

^Contact your provider if you need to [complain about a pension](/pension-complaints).^
