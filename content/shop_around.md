# Shop around and compare providers

Whatever you decide to do with your pension pot you don’t have to stay with your current pension provider.

For example, one option is to buy a guaranteed income for a fixed period or the rest of your life (an annuity).

You don’t have to buy one from your current provider. Moving your pension pot to another provider could give you access to a wider range of annuities and a higher income.

The ‘wake-up’ pack your provider sends you when you reach retirement age is likely to include information about their own products only. Research shows that 8 out of 10 people would have benefited from switching providers (Financial Conduct Authority, Thematic Review of Annuities, Feb 2014).

You can choose to shop around by yourself or with help from a [financial adviser](/financial-advice).

##Comparing annuities

To compare annuities, you generally need to have the following information ready:

* the value of your pension pot
* the age you plan to retire
* your postcode
* the type of annuity you want (eg, one that only pays income for a fixed term, or one that continues to pay your partner after your death)
* your health details (eg, some annuities pay more if you smoke or have a medical condition)

You can read more about the different kinds of annuity and compare annuity rates on the [Money Advice Service website](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/annuities) or speak to a financial adviser to help you compare or discuss products you’ve found.

###Comparing annuities - what to look out for

Before you shop around, ask your current provider if they offer a [guaranteed annuity rate](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/retirement-choices/buying-an-annuity-how-to-shop-around/guaranteed-annuity-rates) - a fixed rate which was set when you started your pension.

Many pensions sold before 1990 offered these rates. They may offer better value than annuities available elsewhere.

You should also check whether your current provider charges any penalties for moving to a different provider. This could affect how much money you get from your pension pot.

There are many different kinds of annuity and rates vary between providers. For example, if you have a health condition that affects your life expectancy you may get more from an ‘enhanced’ annuity.

You should always compare annuities before making a final decision.

Once you’ve bought one you only have a short period when you can still change your mind (in most cases 30 days). After that you can’t change the decision.

^Ask about commission charges that might be included in the quotes you get.^

##Comparing flexi-access drawdown products

To compare products where you get an adjustable income you’ll need some knowledge of investing.

You need to know which funds and markets to invest in to make sure your money lasts and keeps up with or beats the rate of inflation. You also need to look out for fees. A financial adviser can help you with this and your flexi-access drawdown choices.

###Comparing flexi-access - what you need

To compare flexi-access drawdown products you need to:

* understand investment terms and choices
* look at the options available on each product
* make decisions about where you want to invest your money
* check investment management and administration fees

You also need to know how your [pension pot will be taxed](/tax) every time you take money out of it.

%If your investments don’t perform well and you take too much money from your pension pot, you could run out of retirement income.%

Moving your money into a flexi-access drawdown investment may involve moving your pot to a different provider. If you’re not confident with investing it may not be right for you.

You should consider speaking to a financial adviser before getting a flexi-access drawdown investment.
