#How to shop around for the best deal

Whatever you decide to do with your pension pot you don’t have to stay with your current pension provider.

For example, one option is to buy a guaranteed income for a fixed period or the rest of your life (an annuity).

You don’t have to buy one from your current provider. Moving your pension pot to another provider could give you access to a wider range of annuities and a higher income.

The 'wake-up' pack your provider sends you when you reach retirement age is likely to include information about their own products only. Research shows that 8 out of 10 people would have benefited from switching providers (Financial Conduct Authority, Thematic Review of Annuities, Feb 2014).

You can choose to shop around by yourself or with help from a [financial adviser](/shop-around#getting-financial-advice). You have to pay for financial advice.

##Comparing annuities

Before you shop around, ask your current provider if they offer a [guaranteed annuity rate](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/retirement-choices/buying-an-annuity-how-to-shop-around/guaranteed-annuity-rates) - a fixed rate which was set when you started your pension.

Many pensions sold before 1990 offered these rates. They may offer better value than annuities available elsewhere.

You should also check whether your current provider charges any penalties for moving to a different provider. This could affect how much money you get from your pension pot.

There are many different kinds of annuity and rates vary between providers. For example, if you have a health condition that affects your life expectancy you may get more from an ‘enhanced’ annuity.

You should always compare annuities before making a final decision.

once you’ve bought one you only have a short period when you can still change your mind (in most cases 30 days). After that you can’t change the decision.

###Comparing annuities - what you need

To compare annuities, you generally need to have the following information ready:

* the value of your pension pot
* the age you plan to retire
* your postcode
* the type of annuity you want (eg, one that only pays income for a fixed term, or one that continues to pay your partner after your death)
* your health details (eg, some annuities pay more if you smoke or have a medical condition)

You can read more about the different kinds of annuity and compare annuity rates on the [Money Advice Service website](https://annuities.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/xml/annuitiesMAS/an_form.cfm) or speak to a financial adviser to help you compare or discuss products you’ve found.

##Comparing flexi-access drawdown products

To compare products where you take money from your pension pot as and when you need it (flexi-access drawdown) you’ll need some knowledge of investing.

You need to know which funds and markets to invest in to make sure your money lasts and keeps up with or beats the rate of inflation. You also need to look out for fees. A financial adviser can help you with this and your flexi-access drawdown choices.

###Comparing flexi-access drawdown - what you need

To compare flexi-access drawdown products you need to:

* understand investment terms and choices
* look at the options available on each product
* make decisions about where you want to invest your money
* check investment management and administration fees

You also need to know how your [pension pot will be taxed](/tax) every time you take money out of it.

%If your investments don't perform well and you take too much money from your pension pot, you could run out of retirement income.%

Getting an flexi-access drawdown product may involve moving your pot to a different provider. If you're not confident with investing it may not be right for you.

You should consider speaking to a financial adviser before getting an flexi-access drawdown product.

##Getting financial advice

Comparing retirement income products can be complicated. You may wish to speak to a financial adviser to help you. They'll look at your circumstances and recommend what you can do with the money in your pension pot.

The more information you have prepared when you meet with one, the more you will benefit. This includes details of the value of your pension pot and other income.

Check your adviser is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) before you pay for advice. You can check the [FCA register](http://www.fsa.gov.uk/register/home.do) to make sure.

###What a financial adviser will do

An adviser will ask about your current financial position, your goals and how you feel about taking risks with your money. This will help them to recommend retirement income products that are right for you now and in the future.

You should always ask an adviser if they’re independent or restricted. Restricted advisers are limited to certain products (eg only annuities), providers or both. Independent advisers cover the whole market and are not restricted to one product type or provider.

This list from the FCA explains what [an adviser might ask you](http://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/financial-services-products/investments/financial-advice/what-an-adviser-might-ask-you).

###Paying for financial advice

The fees for getting financial advice vary. You need to know what fees and charges up front and when you’re expected to pay.

You’ll pay a one-off fee if you see the adviser once, or a regular fee if the advice is ongoing. You can start by finding out if there’s a fee for an initial consultation. Many advisers offer this for free.
