# Taking cash

There are 2 ways you can take cash from you pension pot.

You can:

- take cash out in chunks
- take your whole pot in one go

## Taking cash in chunks

You can take chunks of cash from your pension pot until it runs out. You can do this with any pension pot size but if you have a larger pot you might want to think about getting an income from it with an [annuity](/guaranteed-income) or [adjustable income](/adjustable-income).

With this option your pot stays where it is and you take money out when you want to. 25% of each amount you take out is tax free, the rest is taxable.

Your provider pays you the money with any [tax due](/tax) already taken off.

**Example**
Your pot is £60,000. You take £6,000 out as cash every year - £1,500 would be tax-free every time, £4,500 would be taxable. If you pay 20% tax you would get £5,100 out of your £6,000.

You might also have to pay administration charges, including charges every time you withdraw money.

With this option, your pot will eventually run out. Think about how much your take out every year and how long you want your money to last.

### Continue to pay in

If you take cash in chunks you could also still pay into other pension pots, up to a limit of £10,000 a year. This includes your tax relief of 20%. For example, to get a contribution of £10,000 you would only have to pay in £8,000.

You can also pay into the pot you already take cash from but you won’t get tax relief on these payments.

## Taking your whole pot in one go

If you take your whole pension pot in one go - 25% is tax-free and the remaining [75% is taxable](/tax).

**Example**
Your pot is £60,000.
You can take £15,000 tax-free.
The remaining £45,000 would be taxable.

If you’re considering this option you should think about how you can use the money to give you an income in retirement.

%Taking a large sum of cash from your pension pot can mean you pay a higher amount of tax.%

## Your next steps

Here are some next steps if you’re interested in taking cash:

Cash in chunks:

- check with your current provider if they offer the option and what they charge - if they don’t offer it, you can transfer your pot but you might be charged
- check if your pot has any special arrangements attached to it that could mean you get a better deal, eg a guaranteed value at a certain time
- make sure you know [how much tax](/tax) you’ll pay on any money you’re planning to take out

Taking your whole pot:

- check with your provider if you can take 25% tax free
- make sure you know [how much tax you’ll pay](/tax) on the remaining 75%
- if you want to reinvest the money, talk to a [registered financial adviser](http://www.fca.org.uk/register) first
