# Taking cash in chunks

You can take smaller sums of cash from your pot until it runs out. How much and when you take the money is your decision.

With this option the 25% tax free isn’t paid as one lump sum. Instead, you get it in chunks over the time you take money from your pot. Every time you take a chunk out, 25% of the amount you take is tax free and the remaining 75% is taxable.

**Example**
Your pot is £60,000.
You take out £10,000 each year.
£2,500 is tax free.
£7,500 is taxable.
You don’t have any other income and this is below the Personal Allowance of £10,600.
**You don’t pay tax on your cash.**

Any cash your provider pays you will have the [tax owed](/tax) already taken off. Some providers also charge you to take cash out.

Taking a large sum of cash from your pension pot could also affect [your entitlement to any benefits](/benefits).

Pension providers may describe this option as ‘Uncrystallised Funds Pension Lump Sum’ (UFPLS).

## Watch out for higher tax

It’s important to calculate how much tax you might pay if you want to take your pension pot as cash.

The cash you take will be added to any other income you have over the tax year.  At the end of the tax year HM Revenue and Customs will calculate how much tax you owe.

If you spread the cash amounts over more than one tax year, you might pay less tax on them. Adding a large cash sum to your income could mean that you get bumped into a higher tax rate.

## Continuing to pay in

If you have multiple pension pots, you can take chunks of cash from one and continue to pay into others. The maximum you can pay in is £10,000 a year. This includes your tax relief of 20%. For example, to get a contribution of £10,000 you would only have to pay in £8,000.

You can also pay into the pot you already take cash from but you won’t get tax relief on these payments.

## Your next steps

Here are some next steps if you’re interested in taking cash in chunks:

- ask your current provider if they offer the option and what they charge - if they don’t offer it, you can transfer your pot but you might be charged
- check if your pot has any special arrangements attached to it that could mean you get a better deal, eg a guaranteed value at a certain time
- make sure you know [how much tax](/tax) you’ll pay on any money you’re planning to take out
