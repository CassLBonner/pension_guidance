#Tax you pay on your pension

%The information on this page about tax and pension pot options will apply from 6 April 2015.%

When you get a pension you pay tax on income above your tax-free [Personal Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates/personal-allowances), just like you do on your salary.

The only difference is that you can also take part of your pension pot tax-free. This money doesn't use up any of your Personal Allowance.

How much tax you pay depends on your total income and the [tax rate](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates) that applies to you.

Your taxable income may include:

- any money you get from your pension pot, eg as an [annuity](/pension-pot-options#get-a-guaranteed-income-annuity) or [cash](/pension-pot-options#take-your-whole-pot-as-cash)
- the State Pension
- earnings from employment or self employment
- any other income, eg money from rental income
- any taxable benefits you might get, eg Carer’s Allowance

If you leave your pension pot untouched and don’t take any money out, you don’t pay Income Tax on it.

##What’s tax free
You can usually take part of your pension pot as a tax-free lump sum. Most pensions offer this.

There are 2 ways you can take your tax-free lump sum.

###Take your lump sum in one go
You can take 25% of your whole pension pot tax free.

If you do this, you can't leave the remaining 75% untouched. You must either take it as cash, or buy an [annuity](/pension-pot-options#get-a-guaranteed-income-annuity) with it, or put it into an [flexi-access drawdown](/pension-pot-options#option-1-flexi-access-drawdown) fund.

Any payments you get from the remaining 75% are taxable.

**Example**
Your pot is £60,000 and you take £15,000 tax-free in one go.
You buy an annuity with the remaining £45,000 which pays you £2,000 a year.
This money would be taxable.

###Take smaller sums
You can take smaller cash sums from your pension pot - 25% of each sum would be tax-free.

$E
**Example**
Your pot is £60,000 and you take £1,000 every month. £250 of this amount would be tax-free every time. The remaining £750 would be taxable.

##How much tax you pay

Your Income Tax for the year depends on your [tax rate](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates) and tax-free [Personal Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates).

The Personal Allowance is in addition to your 25% tax-free lump sum.

##Calculating your Income Tax

To figure out how much tax you’ll pay do the following:

s1. Take the 25% you get tax free away from your pension pot.
s2. Add the remaining 75% to any other income you have. The remaining 75% can be a cash sum or income from an annuity or drawdown.
s3. Take your [tax-free Personal Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates/personal-allowances) away from this total.
s4. Check your [tax rate](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates/income-tax-rates) to calculate how much tax you’ll pay for the year.

$E
**Example:**
You’ve decided to take your whole pot of £60,000 as cash.
You also work part-time and make £7,000 a year.

###1. Take 25% away from your pension pot.
25% of £60,000 is £15,000.
This leaves £45,000.

###2. Add your other taxable income.
£45,000 plus £7,000 = £52,000

###3. Take away your tax-free allowance.
You were born after 5 April 1948. Your Personal Allowance is £10,600.

£52,000 minus £10,600 = £41,400

This is your total taxable income for the year.

###4. Check your tax rate
You pay 20% on your income up to £31,785 (the limit for the basic rate of tax) = £6,357

You pay 40% on the remaining £9,615 of your income = £3,846

Total tax you pay for the year: £10,203

##How your tax is paid

###Tax on your pension income
Any money you get from a pension provider will be paid to you with the tax already taken off. This goes for flexi-access drawdown, an annuity, or cash payments.

The pension provider will also deduct any tax due on your State Pension.

###When you start taking money from your pension pot

Usually your income changes when you stop working and start taking money from your pension pot. This means HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have to recalculate your tax. 

^The changes in your income can mean you’re paying more tax than expected when you first take money from your pension pot until HMRC sends you a new tax code.^

The way HMRC recalculate your tax depends on whether you have a P45 or not. You get this document from your employer when you stop working for them or from your own company (as a company director) when you stop getting an income from it. The P45 shows how much tax you paid in the present or previous tax year. 

This is what you have to do and what happens next: 

s1. You send parts 2 and 3 of your P45 to your pension provider or tell them you don’t have a P45.
s2. Your pension provider tells HMRC that you have started to receive pension payments or have taken out all your money.
s3. Your pension provider takes tax from your pension money. They’ll base the tax on your first payment on your tax rate from the P45. If you don’t have a P45 you’ll be given a temporary [emergency tax code](https://www.gov.uk/emergency-tax-code). This means you’ll pay Income Tax on everything above £883.33 a month (monthly portion of your £10,600 tax-free Personal Allowance) until HMRC sends a new tax code to your provider.
s4. At the end of the tax year HMRC will check you have paid the right amount of tax. If you owe tax or have overpaid, they’ll send you a tax calculation and a new tax code to your provider. They’ll use this to work out how much tax to take from your pension payments for that tax year.
s5. HMRC will send you a ‘PAYE coding notice’ which explains the changes.
s6. You can [claim back any tax you’ve overpaid](https://www.gov.uk/claim-tax-refund/you-get-a-pension).


###If you continue to work
Your employer will take any tax due off your earnings and your State Pension. This is called Pay As You Earn (PAYE).

If you’re self-employed you have to fill in a [Self-Assessment tax return](https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns). You must declare your overall income, including the State Pension and any other private pensions, eg your workplace pension.

###If you have other income
You’re responsible for paying tax on other income you have, eg from property or investments. You might have to fill in a [Self-Assessment tax return](https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns).

###Lifetime allowance
You'll have to pay tax on any amount in your pension pot above your [lifetime allowance of £1.25 million](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension).
