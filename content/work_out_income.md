# Work out your retirement income

To work out if you’ll have enough money to live on in retirement, you’ll need to:

- look at what your living costs are likely to be
- find out what you’ll get from your pension pot, the State Pension and any other income you may have
- work out the tax you’ll pay on your retirement income
- think about how long your money will need to last

^If you decide you won’t have enough to live on after you retire, you could look at ways to [increase your retirement income](making-money-last).^

## Find out how much you'll need

Add up all the living costs you have now. You can use the [Money Advice Service’s budget planner](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/budget-planner) to help you work out what they are.

Take away these costs from your retirement income. This will give you an idea of whether you’ll have enough money through retirement.

Your living costs may change when you retire. For example, you could spend less on travel or your mortgage but more on energy bills or [care costs](/care-costs).

## Work out how long it needs to last

You need to think about how to make your money last the rest of your life. 

You can use the [Office of National Statistics calculator](/http://visual.ons.gov.uk/how-long-will-my-pension-need-to-last/) to estimate your life expectancy. This can help you plan how long your pension may need to last but lifestyle choices and other factors may affect how long you live.

%Taking too much of your pension money in early retirement could mean you don't have enough for later.%

## Work what you might have

To get an idea of how much you’ll have in retirement, follow these steps:

s1. [Check how much is in your pension pot](/pension-pot-value) and which pensions you’ve paid into.
