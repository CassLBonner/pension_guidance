# Work out what you’ll have in retirement

When you reach retirement your income is likely to be less. This is mostly because your income from work drops if you go part-time or when you stop working altogether. Your retirement income usually isn’t as much as your salary.

You should think about [what you can do with your pension pot](/pension-pot-options) to make sure you can [make your money last through retirement](/making-money-last).

## Add up all your income

How you take the money from your pension pot depends on how much other income you have. You should start by adding up all your income.

### Most common income in retirement

You’ll most likely have:

- a pension - this might be one or more pensions from work, pensions you set up yourself, or both
- the State Pension paid to you by the government

[Check the value of your pension pot](/pension-pot-value) if you don’t know. Call the Future Pension Centre on 0345 600 4274 for a full State Pension statement.

### Other income

You might also have other income:

- from work - if you carry on working for some years
- benefits, eg pension credit, housing benefit, council tax discount
- rental income
- interest from savings or pensioner bonds
- dividends from investments
- from property, eg by downsizing

^Taking money from your pension pot can [affect your benefits](/benefits).^

## If you only have income from pensions

Once you stop working and you don’t have any other income, your retirement income will be made up of your own pension(s) plus the State Pension.

### How to calculate your retirement income

To get a basic idea of how much you’ll have in retirement, follow these steps:

s1. Understand [what you can do with your pension pot](/pension-pot-options). Decide if you want a guaranteed income (annuity) every year or the option to take an adjustable income or cash in chunks from your pension pot when you want to.
s2. [Shop around](/shop-around) and get quotes from providers. For annuities they’ll tell you how much you might get a year for the amount in your pot. For an adjustable income or cash in chunks they might be able to tell you how much your pot could grow and how long it would last if you take a certain amount every year. Get quotes for different options and ask about any charges that are included.
s3. Decide which option(s) suit you the best. You might want to talk to a [financial adviser](/financial-advice).
s4. Add the most suitable quote to your State Pension. If you also have a defined benefit pension, add that money too.
s5. Take away the [tax you pay on your pension(s)](/tax).

**Example**

You’re 65 and you decide to stop working. You have the basic State Pension and your pension pot.

What you have | Amount
- | -
Full basic State Pension per year | £6,029.40
Your total pension pot | £30,000

### What you do with your pension pot

You decide to take 25% of your pot tax free and take money from this amount every year. You buy a single annuity with the rest. This kind of annuity won’t continue to pay to your spouse or partner after you die.

What you do with it | Amount
- | -
25% tax free | £7,500 in one go
You buy an annuity with the remaining pot of £22,500 | This will pay £1,125 per year until you die

**What you get from 65 onwards**

Income | Amount per year
- | -
Basic State Pension | + £6,029.40
Annuity income | + £1,125
**Your total retirement income** | **= £7,154**

Your income is below the tax-free Personal Allowance of £10,600, so you won’t pay tax on it.

You also have the £7,500 tax-free money to supplement your income.

## If you have other income

If you continue working for a while and have other income, your retirement income will be made up of:

- your own pension
- the State Pension
- other income you have

### How to calculate your retirement income

To get a basic idea of how much you’ll have in retirement follow these steps:

s1. Check how your other income will change in retirement. The easiest way to do this is to think about your 60s, 70s and 80s and how your income might drop. For example, you might want to stop working in your late 60s which means you’ll have less income.
s2. Understand [what you can do with your pension pot](/pension-pot-options) and decide when you need this money. For example, while you’re still working you might want to leave your pension pot untouched so you can take more later.
s3. [Shop around](/shop-around) and get quotes from providers. For annuities they’ll tell you how much you might get a year for the amount in your pot. For an adjustable income or cash in chunks they might be able to tell you how much your pot could grow and how long it would last if you take a certain amount every year. Get quotes for different options and ask about any charges that are included.
s4. Decide which option(s) suits you the best. You might want to talk to a [financial adviser](/financial-advice).
s5. Add the most suitable quote to your State Pension and other income.
s6. Take away the [tax you pay on all your income](/tax).

## Costs in retirement

Add up all the costs you have now. You can use [Money Advice Service’s budget planner](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/budget-planner) to help you work out what they are.

Take away these costs from your retirement income. This will give you an idea if you’ll have enough money in retirement.

Things you have to pay for in retirement usually include:

- living costs, eg food and clothes
- mortgage or payments
- energy and water bills
- TV, phone and internet
- interest on loans
- care costs
- travel
- leisure

Over the years your needs will change, meaning some of these things will go down and some will go up.

You might pay less on:

- travel – some public transport is free once you reach [State Pension age](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension)
- your mortgage – this might be paid off
- living costs

You might pay more for:

- energy and water bills - you may spend more time at home
- care costs

## Paying more into your pension pot

If you don’t think you’ll have enough income in your retirement you could consider adding more to your pot before you retire. You could talk to a financial adviser about how to contribute more to your pot. 

You can also find out about [ways to boost your pension](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/ways-to-boost-your-pension-in-the-run-up-to-retirement) from the Money Advice Service.

There’s a limit to how much you can pay into your pot and still get tax relief. You can pay in up to your [annual allowance](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/annual-allowance).

## The State Pension

You can push back when you start receiving the State Pension to help increase your income in retirement. This is called [deferring the State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/deferring-state-pension/what-you-may-get).

You may be able to [top up your State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/statepensiontopup).
